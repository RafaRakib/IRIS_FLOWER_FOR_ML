The Iris dataset is one of the most famous and widely used datasets in data science, statistics, and machine learning. Introduced by British biologist and statistician Ronald A. Fisher in 1936, the dataset was originally created for demonstrating discriminant analysis but has since become a standard for testing classification algorithms.

The dataset contains 150 samples from three different species of the Iris flower:

*Iris setosa

*Iris versicolor

*Iris virginica

Each sample (or row) includes four features (independent variables) that describe the physical characteristics of the flower:

1.Sepal length (in centimeters)

2.Sepal width (in centimeters)

3.Petal length (in centimeters)

4.Petal width (in centimeters)
